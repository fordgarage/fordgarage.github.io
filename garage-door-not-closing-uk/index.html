<h3 id="door-is-in-the-closed-position">Door Is In The Closed Position;</h3><p>This is a video dealing specifically with the issue of a door not closing all the way either in the up or down position. Human beings can forget to shut the door behind them, at times. Show activity on this post. Push the garage door curtain upwards to open.</p>
<h3 id="this-objective-can-not-be-met-if-the-garage-entry-door-is-open">This Objective Can Not Be Met If The Garage Entry Door Is Open.</h3><p>A main component of any garage doors is the hinges. If there’s something blocking the door from closing all the way, a full close will be impossible. If your garage door or shutter does not close, we would suggest that you check the safety sensors and adjust them so they are correct. They work by transmitting a beam between them, and if anything gets in the way of the beam, it will not allow the door to close, which is an essential safety feature normally, but can cause problems when triggered at inconvenient times.</p>
<h3 id="if-the-door-closes-test-the-safety-reversal-after-this-adjustment-but-if-the-door-doesnt-close-try-switching-the-positions-of-the-sensors-in-your-garage">If The Door Closes, Test The Safety Reversal After This Adjustment But If The Door Doesn’t Close, Try Switching The Positions Of The Sensors In Your Garage.</h3><p>In turn, this can prevent your door from closing and locking properly, compromising the security of your garage. I suspect there is an adjustable limit switch in the motor / gear box that determines when the door should stop moving downwards just before it touches the ground ( with a separate limit switch to stop it in the fully open position ). The unit was sold to us by a company called global who have since gone under. If your door has a gap on one side or the other when it’s closed, the problem is most likely due to a break or other issue with one of the extension springs.</p>
<h3 id="however-i-can039t-fully-see-the-springs-in-this-position">However, I Can't Fully See The Springs In This Position.</h3><p>If you have confirmed that the reason why your garage door is not closing fully is due to sensor failure, all you need to do is to purchase a new pair of sensors and replace the faulty ones. Use spring loaded hinges or use a door closer. Why won't my door close on the remote control. In these cases, the door will detect an obstacle when there is none, causing it to open again.</p>
